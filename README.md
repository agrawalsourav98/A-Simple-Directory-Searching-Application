# A-Simple-Directory-Searching-Application
This application is built on Visual C++ and demonstrates how B+ Trees are used to index directory metadata for easy and/or fast searching for items in directories.

A basic UI is available where user selects the directory to be indexed and the directory gets indexed.
After indexing it provides searching functionality where search returns the path if the item is found.
If multiple files/folders are all such paths are returned.
